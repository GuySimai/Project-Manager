The project aims to develop a project management system for a web development company, similar to the well-known "Monday" platform. The system will facilitate efficient management of projects, tasks, teams, and payments while enhancing communication and collaboration among team members. Additionally, it aims to make project management a more convenient and user-friendly experience for both team members and clients.
